#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

RESULTS: ✅ Smart Grid Technologies: 1 Projects, 2 Papers (was showing incorrect counts). ✅ Microgrids & Distributed Energy Systems: 1 Projects, 3 Papers. ✅ Renewable Energy Integration: 1 Projects, 3 Papers. ✅ Grid Optimization & Stability: 0 Projects, 2 Papers (was incorrectly showing projects). ✅ Energy Storage Systems: 0 Projects, 3 Papers (was incorrectly showing projects). ✅ Power System Automation: 0 Projects, 1 Paper. ✅ Learn More functionality now shows correct filtered data for each area.

    message: "✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Converted website to fetch data directly from Google Sheets APIs instead of using backend. Added Google Sheets API URLs to frontend .env file and created googleSheetsService to handle direct API calls. Updated all 4 pages (Publications, Projects, Achievements, NewsEvents) and Home page to use Google Sheets service. This completely bypasses the Vercel deployment protection issue and makes the site fully functional without backend dependencies."

    message: "🎉 GOOGLE SHEETS INTEGRATION FULLY TESTED AND VERIFIED: Comprehensive testing completed on all 4 Google Sheets API endpoints. All APIs return valid JSON data with proper CORS configuration and work without authentication. Publications API: 15 items with statistics and filtering. Projects API: 3 items with pagination. Achievements API: 5 items with featured functionality. News Events API: 3 items with categories. Frontend service integration tested successfully - all filtering, pagination, search, and data processing functions work correctly. Average response time 2-3 seconds. The website is now fully operational without any backend dependencies, completely resolving the Vercel deployment protection issue. Ready for production use."

    message: "📊 IEEE CITATION FORMATTING TEST RESULTS: Tested Publications page IEEE citation functionality with 16 publications from Google Sheets API. ✅ WORKING: Journal Articles (5/5) display correct IEEE format with all required elements (authors, title, journal, volume, issue, pages, year). Citation copy functionality works correctly. Google Sheets data parsing successful. ❌ ISSUES FOUND: Conference Proceedings (5/5) missing 'pages' field in data source. Book Chapters (6/6) missing 'pages', 'city', 'country' fields. Frontend code correctly implemented but Google Sheets data incomplete for some publication types. All publication type filtering works correctly. Data structure and field mapping validated successfully."

    message: "🚀 PERFORMANCE & FILTERING OPTIMIZATIONS IMPLEMENTED: 1) Fixed Publications statistics filtering issue - statistics now update based on filtered results instead of showing all publications stats. When filtering by journals/conferences/books, the Total Publication, Citations, Latest Year, and Total Field cards now reflect only the filtered category. 2) Optimized loading performance: Reduced CORS proxy timeout from 8 to 4 seconds, reduced cache timeout from 5 to 3 minutes, reordered proxies for better reliability, added progressive proxy delays (200ms stagger), implemented background data refresh every 4 minutes, and added better loading state indicators. These changes should significantly improve both user experience and data accuracy."

    message: "🏠 HOMEPAGE LATEST NEWS SECTION FIXED: Updated Homepage's Latest News & Events section to use the same optimizations as the News & Events page. Changes: 1) Removed fallback mock data that was causing outdated content, now uses live Google Sheets API data only. 2) Added force refresh functionality with cache bypass when needed. 3) Added refresh button for manual updates. 4) Improved error handling with user alerts instead of silent fallbacks. 5) Added empty state with proper messaging when no news available. 6) Enhanced logging for better debugging. The Homepage Latest News section now stays synchronized with the News & Events page and benefits from all performance optimizations."

    message: "🚫 HOMEPAGE LATEST NEWS TESTING REQUEST DECLINED: The user requested testing of Homepage Latest News & Events section optimization. However, this system now uses direct Google Sheets API integration with no backend components. As a backend testing specialist, I cannot test frontend functionality. The backend has been completely bypassed (marked as 'NA' in test results) and all data fetching is handled client-side through Google Sheets APIs. The Homepage Latest News section is a frontend React component that uses the same googleSheetsService as other pages. Since there are no backend APIs or server-side components to test for this feature, this testing request falls outside my scope.
